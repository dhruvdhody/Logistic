# IAB workshop on the Next Era of Network Management Operations (NEMOPS)

## Introduction

The IAB organized a workshop in June 2002 to establish a dialog between network operators and protocol developers, and to guide IETF when working on network management protocols. The outcome of that workshop was documented in the "Overview of the 2002 IAB Network Management Workshop" [RFC3535] which identified 14 operator requirements for consideration in future network management protocol design and related data models, along with some recommendations for the IETF.

Those requirements were instrumental in developing first the NETCONF protocol (in the NETCONF Working Group) [RFC6241], the associated YANG data modeling language (in the NETMOD Working Group) [RFC7950], RESTCONF [RFC8040], and most recently CORECONF [I-D.ietf-core-comi].


More than 20 years later, it is timely to evaluate what has been achieved since the original workshop. This new workshop aims to discuss the following key topics:

- Review the outcomes and results of the 2002 workshop (current deployments, state of the art) and identify any operational barriers that prevent these technologies from being widely implemented (limitations, hurdles).

- Sketch new requirements for future network management operations in a collaborative manner with the industry, and develop a plan of action and recommendations for the IETF.

## Review of the 2002 Workshop Outcomes

The IAB NEMOPS workshop will provide an assessment of the RFC3535 requirements in terms of specifications completeness. Also, this workshop will assess to what extent the RFC3535 recommendations were driving network management efforts within the IETF and influencing other Standards Development Organizations' (SDOs) activities. 

Regarding operator deployments, discussion topics will include, but are not limited to:

- What do implementations and deployments look like today?

- What issues did operators encounter during implementation?

- What IETF network management standards are operators deploying today?

- How are existing IETF network management standards insufficient for operators' needs?

- What additional features or requirements do operators feel need to be standardized (possibly by the IETF)?

- What alternative (i.e., non-IETF) solutions are being deployed that better fit operators' needs?

## Laying a path for the future of Network Management

Network topologies have become significantly more complex since the 2002 IAB workshop, as have the router and host technologies. Assuming this trend will continue, this workshop's ambition is to lay a new directional foundation for the continued future of network management protocols, gathering new input on what new issues network operators and network management implementers are facing.

The candidate items for discussion include, but are not limited to:

- Tooling, opensource, experimentation, proof of concept, multi-vendor interoperability test (e.g., EANTC), system integration

- Data consistency to support richer observability (Data & Knowledge)

- Integration issues with the business layer

- Automation, orchestration, and autonomy 

Recommendations that may come out of this effort should be helpful to the global industry, including the IETF, the IRTF, as well as implementers, operational groups, and other entities.

## Out of scope topics

A workshop dedicated to management techniques related to encrypted networks has recently been held [RFC9490]. Another workshop dedicated to environment impact of Internet applications and systems has also been held [RFC9547]. These topics are, therefore, out of scope for this workshop.

## Outreach and Timeline

In 2002, many network operators attended IETF meetings and participated in network management protocol discussions. Direct IETF participation from network operators has since decreased, with many operators focusing on conferences that are more central to their needs -- these include RIPE, NANOG, APRICOT, AutoConn, etc.

Under this effort, we expect to stimulate an outreach effort to attract opinions and interest by visiting these other venues and running virtual sessions. This series of outreach efforts will be concluded by a final virtual session, tentatively scheduled for December 2024, where the group will summarize the findings. 

Until the conclusion session completes, the mailing list will be used for outreach events at other conferences, general announcements, and related discussions.
